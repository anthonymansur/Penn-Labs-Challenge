Penn Labs Frontend challenge 

=========

Welcome! Thank you for taking the time in evaluating me for your web development position and in carefully reading this. 

The frontend-challenge.html file contains the html code with the three required features.

1. Menu 

The menu was created with bootstrap's nav-bar component. It includes some customization to fit the mockup design. It is fully responsive, has a logo section to include a brand image or any other feature, and the menu-items are centered to the right. A dropdown menu-item is also included. The menu is fully functional, the only thing that is needed is to change the link on each menu-item to an actual page.


2. Form

The form was created with bootstrap's form component. It includes various customization to fit the mockup design. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the design (although it looks good visually on a sketch pad, it's very difficult to get it just right to line it well), the form isn't responsive. If I had more time, I'd think of a different user-friendly design or spend more time making it logically collapsable when the screen shrinks. 

The form is responsive to user input.  With some jQuery, users can now be alerted if there is an errors in the form or if there form was sent successfully. Note, the form doesn't actually function; although with a little bit of php, I can make it functional! Also, all the data can be collected. Upon submitting, the user will be addressed by their first name and assured that the form has been submitted.


3. Shopping Cart
Note that the shopping cart animation isn't from the link that was sent. I realized this after I made this and instead of deleting what I did, I left my version - it's not that bad either. A user can click on the shopping button and a modal will be opened where they can visualize the shopping cart. Further integration can be made to this shopping cart.

=========

Again, thank you for reading over my application and my challenges, and I personally thank Arun Kirubarajan for taking his time in interviewing me.

P.S. I'd go above and beyond on this project and add a whole bunch of integration to it, but my time is very limited this weekend so I hope it is understood when judging my work.
